  abstract = {Infrastructure as a Service clouds are a flexible and fast way to obtain
                  (virtual) resources as demand varies. Grids, on the other hand, are
                  middleware platforms able to combine resources from different
                  administrative domains for task execution. Clouds can be used by grids
                  as providers of devices such as virtual machines, so they only use the
                  resources they need. But this requires grids to be able to decide when
                  to allocate and release those resources. Here we introduce and analyze
                  by simulations an economic mechanism (a) to set resource prices and (b)
                  resolve when to scale resources depending on the users' demand. This
                  system has a strong emphasis on fairness, so no user hinders the
                  execution of other users' tasks by getting too many resources.

                  Our simulator is based on the well-known GridSim software for grid
                  simulation, which we expand to simulate infrastructure clouds. The
                  results show how the proposed system can successfully adapt the amount
                  of allocated resources to the demand, while at the same time ensuring
                  that resources are fairly shared among users.}

  abstract = {This paper surveys the risks brought by multitenancy in software platforms,
                  along with the most prominent solutions proposed to address them. A
                  multitenant platform hosts and executes software from several users
                  (tenants). The platform must ensure that no malicious or faulty code
                  from any tenant can interfere with the normal execution of other users'
                  code or with the platform itself. This security requirement is specially
                  relevant in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds. PaaS clouds offer an
                  execution environment based on some software platform. Unless PaaS
                  systems are deemed as safe environments users will be reluctant to trust
                  them to run any relevant application. This requires to take into account
                  how multitenancy is handled by the software platform used as the basis
                  of the PaaS offer. This survey focuses on two technologies that are or
                  will be the platform-of-choice in many PaaS clouds: Java and .NET. We
                  describe the security mechanisms they provide, study their limitations
                  as multitenant platforms and analyze the research works that try to
                  solve those limitations. We include in this analysis some standard
                  container technologies (such as Enterprise Java Beans) that can be used
                  to standardize the hosting environment of PaaS clouds. Also we include a
                  brief discussion of Operating Systems (OSs) traditional security
                  capacities and why OSs are unlikely to be chosen as the basis of PaaS
                  offers. Finally, we describe some research initiatives that reinforce
                  security by monitoring the execution of untrusted code, whose results
                  can be of interest in multitenant systems.  },

abstract = {Thanks to the availability of Grids and their middleware, a seamless access to computation and storage resource is provided to application developers and scientists. The D{\'e}crypthon project is one example of such high performance platform. In this paper, we present the architecture of the platform, the middleware developed to ease the access to several servers deployed over France and an example of an application taking advantage of its capacity.},
