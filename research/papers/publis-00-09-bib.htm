	Abstract = {Within computational Grids, some services (typically software components, e.g., linear algebra libraries) are made available by some servers to some clients. In spite of the growing popularity of such Grids, the service discovery, although efficient in many cases, does not reach several requirements. Among them, the flexibility of the discovery and its efficiency on wide-area dynamic platforms are two major issues. Therefore, it becomes crucial to propose new tools coping with such platforms. Emerging peer-to-peer technologies provide algorithms allowing the distribution and the retrieval of data items while addressing the dynamicity of the underlying network. Whereas merging peer-to-peer technology and Grid infrastructures has been widely suggested, very few implementations are available. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we present the design, the implementation and the experimentation of the first architecture, to our knowledge, extending traditional Network-Enabled Servers (NES) systems with an unstructured peer-to-peer network. This extension allows to dynamically connect distributed agents thus providing to clients an entry point to servers geographically distributed. Our implementation is based on the Diet middleware and the JXTA toolbox and experimentation have been conducted on a high speed network. Then, we study the service discovery in a pure peer-to-peer environment. We describe a new trie-based approach for the peer-to-peer service discovery service, supporting range queries while providing fault-tolerance and taking into account the topology of the underlying network. We validate this approach both by analysis and simulation.},

abstract = {Among existing grid middleware approaches, one simple, powerful, and flexible approach consists of using servers available in different administrative domains through the classical client-server or Remote Procedure Call (RPC) paradigm. Network Enabled Servers implement this model also called GridRPC. Clients submit computation requests to a scheduler whose goal is to find a server available on the grid. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of a middleware developed by the GRAAL team called DIET (for Distributed Interactive Engineering Tool-box). DIET is a hierarchical set of components used for the development of applications based on computational servers on the grid.},

abstract = {The efficiency of service discovery is a crucial point in the development of fully decentralized middlewares intended to manage large scale computational grids. The work conducted on this issue led to the design of many peer-to-peer fashioned approaches. More specifically, the need for flexibility and complexity in the service discovery has seen the emergence of a new kind of overlays, based on tries, also known as lexicographic trees. Although these overlays are efficient and well designed, they require a costly maintenance and do not accurately take into account the heterogeneity of nodes and the changing popularity of the services requested by users. In this paper, we focus on reducing the cost of the maintenance of a particular architecture, based on a dynamic prefix tree, while enhancing it with some load balancing techniques that dynamically adapt the load of the nodes in order to maximize the throughput of the system. The algorithms developed couple a self-organizing prefix tree overlay with load balancing techniques inspired by similar previous works undertaken for distributed hash tables. After some simulation results showing how our load balancing heuristics perform in such an overlay and compare to other heuristics, we provide a fair comparison of this architecture and similar overlays recently proposed.},

	Abstract = {Facing the limits of traditional tools of resource management within computational grids (related to scale, dynamicity, etc. of the platforms newly considered), new approaches, based on peer-to-peer technologies are emerging. The resource discovery and in particular the service discovery is concerned by this evolution. Among the solutions, a promising one is the indexing of resources using trie structures and more particularly prefix trees. The major advantages of trie-structured approaches is the capability to support search queries on ranges of values with a latency growing logarithmically in the number of nodes in the trie. Those techniques are easy to extend to multicriteria searches. One drawback of using tries is its inherent poor robustness in a dynamic environment, where nodes join and leave the network, leading to the split of the tree into a forest, which results in the impossibility to route requests. Within most recent approaches, the fault-tolerance is a prevention mechanism, often replication-based. The replication can be costly in term of resources required. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerance protocol that reconnects subtrees a posteriori, after crashes, to have again a connected graph and then reorder the nodes to rebuild a consistent tree.}

	Abstract = {Facing the limits of traditional tools of resource management within computational grids (related to scale, dynamicity, etc. of the platforms newly considered), new approaches, based on peer-to-peer technologies are emerging. The resource discovery and in particular the service discovery is concerned by this evolution. Among the solutions, a promising one is the indexing of resources using trie structures and more particularly prefix trees. The major advantages of trie-structured approaches is the capability to support search queries on ranges of values with a latency growing logarithmically in the number of nodes in the trie. Those techniques are easy to extend to multicriteria searches. One drawback of using tries is its inherent poor robustness in a dynamic environment, where nodes join and leave the network, leading to the split of the tree into a forest, which results in the impossibility to route requests. Within most recent approaches, the fault-tolerance is a prevention mechanism, often replication-based. The replication can be costly in term of resources required. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerance protocol that reconnects subtrees a posteriori, after crashes, to have again a connected graph and then reorder the nodes to rebuild a consistent tree.},

To this purpose, the GridRPC model has been proposed as a grid version of the classical RPC paradigm, with the goal to build NES (Network-Enabled Server) environments. Paradoxically enough, in this model, data management has not been defined and is now explicitly left at the user's charge. The contribution of this paper is to enhance data management in NES by introducing a transparent data access model, available through the concept of grid data-sharing service. Data management (persistent storage, transfer, consistent replication) is totally delegated to the service, whereas the applications simply access shared data via global identifiers. We illustrate our approach using the DIET GridRPC middleware and the JUXMEM data-sharing service. Experiments performed on the Grid'5000 testbed demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.},

	Abstract = {Resource Discovery is a crucial issue in the deployment of computational grids over large scale peer-to-peer platforms. Because they efficiently allow range queries, Prefix Trees appear to be among promising ways in the design of distributed data structures indexing resources. Self-stabilization is an efficient approach in the design of reliable solutions for dynamic systems. A snap-stabilizing algorithm guarantees that it always behaves according to its specification. In other words, a snap-stabilizing algorithm is also a self-stabilizing algorithm which stabilizes in 0 steps. In this paper, we provide the first snap-stabilizing protocol for trie construction. We design particular tries called Proper Greatest Common Prefix (PGCP) Tree. The proposed algorithm arranges the n label values stored in the tree, in average, in O(h+h') rounds, where h and h' are the initial and final heights of the tree, respectively. In the worst case, the algorithm requires an O(n) extra space on each node, O(n) rounds and O(n^2) actions. However, simulations show that, using relevant data sets, this worst case is far from being reached and confirm the average complexities, making this algorithm efficient in practice.}
